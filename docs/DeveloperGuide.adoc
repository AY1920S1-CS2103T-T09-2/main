== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exerecise/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete t/exercise i/1`.

.Component interactions for `delete t/exercise i/1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExerciseListPanel`, `ExerciseCard` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

.  `Logic` uses the `ExerciseBookParser` class to parse the user command.
.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding an exercise/regime).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores a `PropertyBook` object that represents the custom properties defined by the user.
* stores a `ExerciseBook` object that represents the user's exercises being tracked.
* stores a `ExerciseDatabaseBook` object that represents the database of exercises in ExerHealth.
* stores a `RegimeBook` object that represents the user's regimes.
* stores a `ScheduleBook` object that represents the user's schedules.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Exercise>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/exercise/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Resource Book data in json format and read it back.
* can save the Property Book data in json format and read it back.
[NOTE]
Resource Book data consists of Exercise Book, Regime Book and Schedule Book data


[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.exercise.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Undo/Redo feature
==== Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by the `events` package consisting of `EventHistory`, `EventFactory`,
`EventPayload` and the various `Event` classes.

The `EventHistory` is a singleton class used to store a history of successfully executed commands as `Event` objects.
Instances of `Event` are stored in either the `undoStack` or the `redoStack` depending on the user's course of action.

The `EventHistory` class has two primary methods namely `undo(Model model)` and `redo(Model model)`:

* `eventHistory.undo(model)` -- Undoes the `Event` at the top of the `undoStack`, executes it, and pushes it to the top of the `redoStack`
* `eventHistory.redo(model)` -- Redoes the `Event` at the top of the `redoStack`, executes it, and pushes it to the top of the `undoStack`

These operations are utilised in the `UndoCommand` and `RedoCommand` respectively.

The following steps will describe the full life-cycle of executing an UndoableCommand, and subsequently
the UndoCommand and RedoCommand.

Step 1: When an `UndoableCommand` is executed, relevant information will be added into a newly initialized
`EventPayload`.
[NOTE]
The `EventPayload` is a wrapper class to store key information about the particular `Command` object.
For instance, if an `EditCommand` has been executed, the `EventPayload` will store the `originalExercise`
as well as the `editedExercise`.

Step 2: The `EventFactory` takes in the `UndoableCommand` and generates an `Event` using the `EventPayload`
stored in the `UndoableCommand`.
The `Event` is then added to the undo stack of the `EventHistory`.
[NOTE]
The `EventFactory` checks for the command word of the `UndoableCommand` to decide which specific `Event` object
to generate. It will get the `EventPayload` from the `UndoableCommand` and pass it into the constructor of the
`Event` so that the `Event` captures the key information of the `UndoableCommand`.

Step 3: To undo the latest `UndoableCommand` the user executes the `UndoCommand` by entering `undo`
into the command box.

Step 4: The `UndoCommand` executes `eventHistory.undo(model)`, which prompts the `EventHistory` instance
to pop the next `Event` to undo from the undo stack. Once the `Event` is undone, it will be pushed to the
top of the redo stack.

Step 5: To redo the command that has been undone, the user executes the `RedoCommand`. This execution
behaves similarly to step 4, except that the next `Event` is taken from the top of the redo stack instead
of the undo stack.
[NOTE]
For step 4 and 5, if any of the respective stack is empty when it is needed, a `CommandException` will be thrown
and an error message will be displayed to inform of the user that there are no commands to undo or redo
at the moment.

The following two Sequence Diagrams show a sample flow of the execution when an `EditCommand`, which is an
`UndoableCommand`, has been executed and subsequently undone.

The first diagram (Figure 9) describes the process of storing an `EditEvent` to `EventHistory` during the execution of the
`EditCommand`. The `EventPayload` is only initialized when the `EditCommand` is executed. The `EventPayload` is
subsequently used for the initialization of the `EditEvent`.

.The process of storing an `EditEvent` to `EventHistory`
image::UndoableCommandSequenceDiagram.png[]

The second diagram (Figure 10) here describes the process of undoing the `EditCommand` executed above using the `UndoCommand`.
When the `UndoCommand` is executed, the `EventHistory` calls the `undo` method of the next `Event` in the undo stack
(i.e. the `EditEvent`).

.The process of undoing the `EditCommand`
image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

Given below is a Class Diagram (Figure 11) to show the associations between Event, Command and Model. It is specifically designed
such that only objects that implement the `Event` and `Command` interface will need to handle the `model` class.
[NOTE]
The only commands that implements the `UndoableCommand` are `AddCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, `EditCommand`
and `ClearCommand` and they each stores an `EventPayload` instance.

.The associations between Event, Command and Model
image::EventClassDiagram.png[]

The following Activity Diagram (Figure 12) summarizes what happens when a user enters undoable commands,
the undo command and the redo command.

.The workflow when a user enters an undoable command and performs undo/redo
image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Choice 1: (current choice)** Implements undo and redo of each Command in a separate Event object stored in the EventHistory
** Pros:
*** Uses less memory to store Event objects as compared to entire copes of the Model.
*** Open for extensions and close to modifications as the Event interface only contains undo and redo methods, and can
be easily implemented when new Undoable commands are introduced.
*** Obeys Single Responsibility Principle as Commands simply have to execute what it does and does not need to know
how it is undone or redone
** Cons:
*** UndoableCommand objects are forced to depend on EventPayloads when it does not actually use it directly.
(e.g. for `delete`, the exercise being deleted).

* **Choice 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
** Pros:
*** Uses less memory
** Cons:
*** Violates Single Responsibility Principle as Commands need to know implementation for how it
can be undone or redone and also stores data such as the exercise being deleted in a local field.

* **Choice 3:** Saves the entire model consisting of the exercise, regime, schedule and suggestion lists.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement.
** Cons:
*** May have performance issues in terms of memory usage as multiple lists need to be stored
(i.e. Exercise list, Regime list, Schedule list)
*** Unnecessary storage of irrelevant details such as suggestion list.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* **Choice 1 (current choice):** Use a singleton EventHistory to store stacks of Events generated by a EventFactory.
** Pros:
*** Ensures only one instance of EventHistory exists
*** The EventFactory relies on the Factory pattern and helps to reduce coupling between
EventHistory and each individual Event.
** Cons:
*** The Singleton pattern may have a chance of break if multiple threads initializes the singleton class
at the same time, creating multiple versions of EventHistory.

* **Choice 2:** Use a list to store the history of model objects.
** Pros:
*** Very simple to implement as each step simply requires a deep copy of the model to be created
and stored.
** Cons:
*** Difficult to monitor multiple resource books (e.g. Regime books and Exercise books) as they all
manage different types of resources that can be altered by commands.

==== Design Patterns

The Undo/Redo feature implementation is based on the Singleton, Command, and Factory design patterns

* *Singleton*
** To help ensure that only one copy of `EventHistory` exists during the execution of the program
** Allows easier access by the various command classes (i.e. the UndoableCommands, UndoCommand and RedoCommand)

* *Command*
** Extensions to add a new `Event` is easy and can be done without changing the existing code

* *Factory*
** Suitable for the context of taking in a particular Command and returning a corresponding Event
** Reduces coupling between Command classes and Event classes

// tag::resolvefeature[]

=== Resolve feature
==== Implementation
The resolve feature is used when there is a scheduling conflict that happens within ExerHealth. This feature will alter the state of the program. The state is known by `MainApp` and it is either `State.IN_CONFLICT` or `State.NORMAL`. Only when the state is `State.IN_CONFLICT` will `resolve` commands be allowed.

For the implementation of the resolve feature, the `ResolveCommand` will hold a `Conflict` object which is then passed into `Model`. The concrete implementation, `ModelManager` then resolves the conflict that is being held there. Each `Conflict` object will hold 1 conflicting `schedule` and 1 `schedule` that was originally scheduled on the date.

Shown below is the class diagram for the implementation of the `Resolve` feature.

.Class diagram for Resolve Command
image::ScheduleResolveClassDiagram.png[]

With regards to the flow of the program for a scheduling conflict, the steps are laid out below:

Step 1. User enters a `schedule` command that will cause a scheduling conflict. The `ScheduleCommand` will change `MainApp` state to `State.IN_CONFLICT`.

[NOTE]
`schedule` can conflict with another `schedule` when the dates from the 2 schedules are the same. The method `model.hasSchedule()` returns `true` if that happens.

Step 2. A `CommandResult` object is returned to `MainWindow` where the flag `showResolve` is set to `true`.

Step 3. Upon receipt of the object, `MainWindow` will show the resolve window and the user is required to resolve the conflict.

[NOTE]
The `ResolveWindow` will block all inputs to `MainWindow` and only allow `resolve` command to be entered.

Shown below is the sequence diagram for when a scheduling conflict happens:

.Sequence diagram when a scheduling conflict happens
image::ScheduleConflict.png[]

Step 5. When the user is prompted with the `ResolveWindow`, all the conflicting exercises will be shown in one page. The previously `scheduled regime` on the left and the `conflicting regime` on the right.

Step 6. Once the user issue a `resolve` command correctly, the `model` and `storage` of ExerHealth will be updated to reflect the changes. A new regime will be added for the user from the `resolve`.

[NOTE]
The `ResolveWindow` will only take one valid `resolve` command and `Ui` will close the `ResolveWindow` immediately after the command finishes. The newly made schedule will result in a new `regime` being added to the user's `RegimeList`, so the name of the `regime` in the `resolve` command cannot have any conflicts with current names in `RegimeList`.

Step 7. The `ResolveWindow` then closes upon successful `resolve` and the application continues.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a `schedule` command:

.Activity diagram for when a user enters a `schedule` command
image::ScheduleActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Signalling Schedule Conflict
* **Choice 1 (current choice): ** Using `CommandResult` object
** Pros:
*** Makes use of existing objects in codebase making it easier to implement
*** UI does not have to handle logic when encountering schedule conflicts. It only has to show the `ResolveWindow` and pass the data accordingly.
** Cons:
*** If we have to signal different types of outcomes to the UI, the `CommandResult` class will become bloated.

* **Choice 2: ** throw `ScheduleException`
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement. `ScheduleCommand` just has to throw an exception and `UI` catches it.
** Cons:
*** `UI's` execute methods will contain multiple `try/catch` which acts like a control flow mechanism which increases code smell.
*** If there is a need to pass down information from executed Commands, an exception is unable to convey any sort of complex information that the `UI` can act on. Thus, encapsulating information in an object will be more open to extension compared to throwing an exception.

// end::resolvefeature[]

=== Custom feature
This feature is facilitated by both `PropertyBook` and `CustomProperty`. Whenever a user
adds a newly defined custom property, a `CustomProperty` object will be created which is stored in
`PropertyBook`. Its corresponding prefix and full name will be tracked by `PropertyBook` to avoid
clashes in their uses.

==== Current Implementation
To keep track of the custom properties and its relevant information, the following are used:

1. `CUSTOM_PROPERTIES`: A list containing all of the `CustomProperty` objects that
have been created.

2. `prefixes`: A set containing all of the `Prefix` objects associated with existing exercise's
properties.

3. `fullNames`: A set containing the full names of the existing exercise's properties.

The following methods are also implemented in `PropertyBook` to aid in the addition of a new custom property:

1. `PropertyBook#isPrefixUsed(Prefix)`: Checks if the given prefix has been used by a property.

2. `PropertyBook#isFullNameUsed(String)`: Checks if the given name has been used by a property.

3. `PropertyBook#addCustomProperty(CustomProperty)`: Adds the new custom property. Each time a custom property is
added, the prefix set in `Prefix` is also updated.

The first three methods are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#isPrefixUsed(Prefix)`,
`Model#isFullNameUsed(String)` and `Model#addCustomProperty(CustomProperty)` respectively.
These associations are illustrated in a class diagram (Figure 16).

.Class diagram of the associations of `PropertyBook`
image::CustomClassDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram (Figure 17) illustrates how the custom operation works when a custom
property is *successfully added*.

.Sequence diagram of a successful addition of a custom property
image::EditedCustomSequenceDiagram.png[]

However, not all additions of a custom property will be successful. The next activity diagram
(Figure 18) shows the workflow when a new custom property is defined.

.Activity diagram of the workflow when a new custom property is added
image::CustomActivityDiagram.png[]


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Tracking custom properties
* **Choice 1 (Current choice)**: Store the custom properties in a list and store their full
names and prefixes in a set.
** Pros: Storing the full names and prefixes separately provides an efficient way to check if a
full name or a prefix has been used.
** Cons: It may incur additional memory usage since the full name and prefix of each `CustomProperty`
object are stored multiple times.
* **Choice 2**: Store only a list of custom properties
** Pros: Less memory used as no duplicates in terms of prefix and full names are stored.
** Cons: It may require more time to check if a full name or a prefix has been used as one has to
iterate through the whole list.

Ultimately, choice 1 is chosen as it provides a faster way of checking if a full name or a prefix has
been used. Also, keeping track of the prefixes separately allows us to simply pass them in when adding or
editing an exercise.

===== Aspect: Representing the custom properties
* **Choice 1 (Current choice)**: Represent the custom property as an object that contains
3 information - its prefix, its name and its parameter type.
** Pros: This allows us to distinguish custom properties from default properties. Furthermore, these
objects can be stored in a data structure which can be passed around when adding or editing an exercise.
** Cons: Each exercise has to store the value of each custom property separately from the custom property
itself.

* **Choice 2**: Create a `Property` class which will contain the following information: name, constraint
message, value and prefix. The default properties will be stored separately in a Java class and will be initialised
every time the app starts.
** Pros: This ensures that there is a consistency in terms of how an exercise property is represented
and it also allows the property value to be stored together.
** Cons: Methods have to be introduced to identify custom properties from the default ones.

Ultimately, choice 1 is selected as we believe it is more important to distinguish the custom properties
from the default ones. This separation ensures that methods meant to operate on custom properties are unable
to operate on default properties.

// tag::suggest[]
=== Suggest
==== Implementation
The suggest feature is used to recommend exercises to both beginners and experienced users.
The user is allowed to specify what type of suggestions to see.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a suggest command:

.Activity diagram behind the suggest possible feature

image::SuggestActivityDiagram.png[]

The following sequence diagram shows the sequence flow from the when a user enters a valid `SuggestPossibleCommand`:

.Sequence diagram of the process behind the suggest possible feature

image::SuggestSequenceDiagram.png[]

From the sequence diagram:

1. When the `LogicManager` receive the `execute` command, it calls the `parseCommand` method of `ExerciseBookParser`.

2. `ExerciseBookParser` will receive `suggest` as the command type and instantiate `SuggestCommandParser` to further parse the command.

3. `SuggestCommandParser` will receive `s/possible` as the suggest type and calls the `parsePredicate` method of `ParserUtil`
to parse the user input to create an `ExercisePredicate` object (named `p` in the diagram).

4. `SuggestCommandParser` will instantiate `SuggestPossibleCommand` with the `ExercisePredicate` as the constructor parameter.

5. The `SuggestPossibleCommand` object is then returned to `SuggestCommandParser`, `ExerciseBookParser` and lastly back to `LogicManager` to execute.

6. `LogicManager` will proceed to call execute `SuggestPossibleCommand`.

7. `SuggestPossibleCommand` then calls the `updateSuggestedExerciseList` method in `ModelManager`, passing in the predicate to filter the list of suggest exercises.

8. `SuggestPossibleCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` to be returned.

In step 3, the process in which the `ExercisePredicate` object is created can be explored deeper.

.Sequence diagram of the process in which the predicate for suggest possible command is instantiated.

image::SuggestPredicateSequenceDiagram.png[]

From the sequence diagram above:

1. `ParserUtil` creates `ExerciseMusclePredicate` and `ExerciseCustomPropertyPredicate` with the input parameters.

2. Since there were no CustomProperty tags to filter, `ParserUtil` creates `ExercisePredicate` with only the `musclesPredicate` and the boolean `isStrict`.

3. The resulting `ExercisePredicate` is then returned to `ParserUtil` and then `SuggestCommandParser`.

The diagram below shows the structure of a `ExercisePredicate` object.
A `ExercisePredicate` contains a `list` of `BasePropertyPredicate`,
where each contains a `Collection` of `Muscle` or `CustomProperty`.

.Class diagram of the classes behind the suggest possible feature

image::SuggestCommandClassDiagram.png[]

Creating classes such as `ExerciseCustomPropertyPredicate` and `ExerciseMusclePredicate`
allow us to conduct better testing because we can compare the `Collection` of tags being considered.

==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Implementation of predicate creation
* **Choice 1: ** `SuggestPossibleCommand` to handle the predicates.
** Pros:
*** Easy to implement and understand. The class `SuggestPossibleCommand` contains the parsing and creation of the predicate
all in one place as it stores the tags, and creates the predicate and filters the list of exercises.
** Cons:
*** Violation of SRP as `SuggestPossibleCommand`, in addition to updating the model, has to create the predicate.
* **Choice 2 (current choice): ** Predicate class to handle all predicates.
** Pros:
*** Adheres to Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) and Separation of Concern (SoC).
** Cons:
*** Increases the complexity of the code as more classes are needed, also increasing the lines of code written.
// end::suggest[]

=== Statistics

==== Implementation
Statistics of exercises will be displayed in charts. Supported chart types are Pie Chart, Line Chart and Bar Chart.
StatsFactory will create Statistic using given parameters.
The figure (Figure 19) below shows the class diagram of statistics:

.Class diagram of the classes behind the statistics feature
image::StatisticClassDiagram.png[]

The next figure (Figure 20) shows the activity diagram when user enter a `stats` command:

.Workflow when a user enters a `stats` command
image::StatisticActivityDiagram.png[]

Given below is an example usage scenario of statistics feature.

Step 1: User enters a `stats` command to see statistics of exercises.

Step 2: The `stats` command calls Model#getExerciseBookData to get data of all exercises and pass to `Statistic`.

Step 3: `Statistic` will process and generate data.

Step 4: Data will be passed back to `Ui` and `Ui` will generate and display chart.

Shown below is the sequence diagram (Figure 21) when user enters a valid `stats` command:

.Sequence diagram of a `stats` command
image::StatisticSequenceDiagram.png[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

== Instructions for Manual Testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

[NOTE]
These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on; testers are expected to do more _exploratory_ testing.

=== Launch and Shutdown

. Initial launch

.. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder
.. Double-click the jar file +
   Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample exercises. The window size may not be optimum.

. Saving window preferences

.. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
.. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file. +
   Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

=== Deleting an exercise

. Deleting an exercise while all exercises are listed

.. Prerequisites: List all exercises using the `list` command. Multiple exercises in the list.
.. Test case: `delete t/exercise i/1` +
   Expected: First exercise is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted exercise shown in the status message.
.. Test case: `delete t/exercise i/0` +
   Expected: No exercise is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.
.. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x` (where x is larger than the list size) +
   Expected: Similar to previous.

=== Saving data

. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

.. Prerequisites: Must have ran `ExerHealth` at least once and have `exercisebook.json`.

.. Open up `exercisebook.json` with any text editor and change one of the dates to `//`, representing an invalid date. +
   Expected: `ExerHealth` will start with an empty exercise book due to data corruption. Exercise Panel will be empty.
