== Introduction

Wish to get the summer body that the contestants in your school’s
beauty pageant has? Want to shed some weight that you have gained
from stress-eating?

Well wait no more! ExerHealth is a one-stop platform for students
who wish to embark on a journey of health and fitness. This application
is optimised for students who prefer to work with a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast and wish to maintain a healthy
lifestyle, ExerHealth is that one app for you!

Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started! Enjoy!

== Quick Start

// tag::scheduleresolve[]

=== Scheduling exercises: `schedule`

==== Schedules a regime

Schedules an exercise regime for a certain date. If the regime clashes with another scheduled regime, you will be prompted to resolve the conflict via a popup window. Refer to <<resolve>> for details on resolving scheduling conflicts.

Format: `schedule n/REGIME_NAME d/DATE`

****
* To schedule a regime, `REGIME_NAME` must exist in your regime list. You can use <<list, `list t/regime`>> command to view the regimes that you currently have.
* The format of `DATE` must be of the form `dd/MM/YYYY`. For example, `12/12/2019` or `01/01/2020`. Even if the number has only one digit, please ensure you include a 0 at the front to ensure that it adheres to the format required.
* You will not be allowed to schedule a regime on a date that falls before the date displayed on your system clock
* You are allowed to schedule a regime of the same name on the same date. The resolve window will pop up for you as per normal.
****
*Example 1:*

* `schedule n/cardio d/12/12/2019`

Schedules the regime called `cardio` on the date `12/12/2019`. If there are no other regimes scheduled on `12/12/2019` then the command is successful. Otherwise, you will be prompted to resolve the scheduling conflict.

Expected Result:

image::ScheduleRegimeCardio.png[]

Expected Result (if other schedule exist on `12/12/2019`):

image::ScheduleRegimeCardioConflict.png[]

If the resolve window pops up for you, please refer to <<resolve>> for details on resolving a scheduling conflict.

==== Completes a schedule regime

Once a scheduled regime is completed, you can add that completed schedule to the exercise tracker. The schedule is then deleted from the scheduling list.

Format: `schedule i/INDEX_OF_SCHEDULE`


[TIP]
The `INDEX_OF_SCHEDULE` provided must be a valid index from your schedule list. Please use <<list, `list t/schedule`>> to view you index of the schedule you wish to complete.

*Example:*

* `schedule i/2`

Completes all the exercises that are in the schedule at index `2`. All the exercises scheduled will be added to the exercise list and the schedule at index `2` is deleted.

Expected Result:

Before execution of `schedule i/2`

image::ScheduleCompleteBefore.png[]

In your exercise tracker

image::ScheduleCompleteExerciseTracker.png[]

In your schedule tracker after completing execution of `schedule i/2`

image::ScheduleCompleteScheduleTracker.png[]

// end::scheduleresolve[]

[[resolve]]
=== Resolving scheduling conflicts: `resolve`
Described in the following two sections are two possible ways to resolve a scheduling conflict in the resolve window that pops up.

****
* Once the resolve window pops up, you are not allowed to interact with the main `ExerHealth` window anymore. You are required to resolve the scheduling conflict before continuing to use the application as normal.
* Any *valid* commands that are not `resolve` will not get executed in the resolve window. Only the `resolve` command is allowed in the resolve window.
****

[[resolvetakeone]]
==== Taking one of the regimes completely

Takes the scheduled regime or the conflicting regime completely and discarding the other. Neither regimes will be deleted from the user’s collection.

Format: `resolve n/SCHEDULED_OR_CONFLICTING`

[TIP]
You can only enter `n/scheduled` or `n/conflicting` to tell ExerHealth which schedule you wish to take. The scheduled or conflicting regimes are stated at the top of the list of exercises as shown below.

image::ResolveScheduledOrConflicting.png[]

*Example:*

* `resolve n/scheduled`

Takes the already scheduled regime and schedule it at conflicting date.

*Expected Result:*

The resolve window and inputting the example command

image::ResolveScheduled.png[]

Once resolve window closes, the scheduled regime should be taken and scheduled at the correct date.

image::ResolveScheduledResult.png[]


==== Taking some exercises from both regimes
Takes some exercises from the scheduled regime and some from the conflicting regime to make a brand new regime. The new regime will be scheduled at the date of conflict. This new regime will also be added to your collection of regimes.

Format: `resolve n/NEW_REGIME_NAME [i/INDEX_OF_EXERCISE_IN_SCHEDULED] [r/INDEX_OF_EXERCISE_IN_CONFLICTING]`

****
* Takes the exercise at the specified indexes of `i/` and `r/`
* `NEW_REGIME_NAME` must be a new name that does not exist in your collection of regimes
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed resolve window
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* i/ is for index of the scheduled regime
* r/ is for index of the conflicting regime
* At least one `i/` or `r/` must exist in your input for this command to succeed. Otherwise, ExerHealth will think you are trying to take one regime completely as stated in the <<resolvetakeone, previous section>>.
****

*Example:*

* `resolve n/new cardio i/1 r/4 r/2`

Expected Result:

Takes exercise `1` from `scheduled regime` and exercises `2` and `4` from `conflicting regime` and adds them to a new regime called `new cardio`

image::ResolveTakeOneOrOther.png[]

The `new cardio` regime is now scheduled at the conflicting date with the new exercises that have been resolved.

image::ResolveTakeResolved.png[]

The `new cardio` regime is now added to your collection of regimes

image::ResolveRegimeTracker.png[]


// tag::suggest[]

[[suggestion]]
=== Suggesting ideas: `suggest`

==== Suggest basic exercises
Recommends exercises from ExerHealth's inbuilt database for beginners.

Format: `suggest s/basic`

==== Suggest possible exercises
Suggests exercises matching specified tags.

===== Based on matching muscle tags
Format: `suggest s/possible o/OPERATION_TYPE [m/MUSCLE CUSTOM_PROPERTY_PREFIX_NAME/VALUE]`

****
* You must choose one of the following operation type: `and`, `or`.
* i.e commands such as `suggest s/possible m/Chest m/Legs` will fail whereas `suggest s/possible o/or m/Chest m/Legs` will succeed.

* You have to enter at least one property (muscle/custom property) to search for suggestions.
* i.e commands such as
`suggest s/possible o/and` and `suggest s/possible o/or` will both fail
whereas `suggest s/possible o/or m/Chest` will succeed.

* The operation type is optional if there is only one tag provided
* i.e commands such as
`suggest s/possible o/and m/Chest`, `suggest s/possible o/or m/Chest` and `suggest s/possible m/Chest`
will all achieve the same outcome -
display all the exercises tagged with "Chest" in the exercise tracker and ExerHealth's database.
****
===== Based on matching custom properties

Similar to matching muscles tags, you can search for suggestions with matching custom property tags.

After creating <<customproperty, Custom Properties>> and tracking exercises,
you can search for suggestions with those custom properties.

Example:
Suppose you have created a new Custom Property and have been tracking a few exercises with said custom property:

`custom s/r f/Rating p/Number`

`add t/exercise n/Run d/02/11/2019 c/200 q/10 u/km m/Legs r/8`

`add t/exercise n/Bench Press d/05/11/2019 c/150 q/40 u/kg m/Chest r/8`


Then, the following input will display a list of exercises which are tagged with "Chest" and have a rating of 8.

`suggest s/possible o/and m/Chest r/8`

Thus the command will display only the exercise named "Bench Press".

Expected Result:

image::suggestPossibleAfter1.png[]

The input, `suggest s/possible o/or m/Chest r/8`, however, will display a list of exercises with "Chest" *or* have a rating of 8.

image::suggestPossibleBefore2.png[]

Expected Result:

image::suggestPossibleAfter2.png[]

As seen on the image above, the two previously added exercises named "Bench Press" and "Run" are displayed because they each have a rating of 8.
In addition to the tracked exercises, ExerHealth will also display suggestions in its database. Hence the exercise named "Push Ups" is displayed
as it has a "Chest" muscle tag.

===== Duplicates

Sometimes, you may track exercises of the same name. Instead of displaying all suggestions of the same name, this function
display the information of the most recently tracked exercise of that name.

image::suggestPossibleBefore3.png[]

Expected Result:

image::suggestPossibleAfter3.png[]

As seen on the image above, the tracked exercise named "Bench Press" on "06/11/2019" is displayed instead of the one on "05/11/2019".

****
*Notes:*

* Suggestions from the database have dates displayed refer to the last time ExerHealth's database was updated.

****

// end::suggest[]

// tag::customfeature[]
[[customproperty]]
=== Custom properties

==== Adding custom properties: `custom`

Adds in a custom property which you can define for the exercises.

Once a new custom property is created, you can simply use the prefix name which you defined for the
property to the `add` and `edit` command to include information for the new property.

****
* The prefix name can only contain alphabets and should not contain spaces.
* You must choose exactly one of the following as the parameter type for your custom property:
`Text`, `Number`, `Date`.
* Every word in the full name of each custom property will be changed to Start Case style, where the first letter of each
word is capitalised with the other letters in lower case e.g. `enD DaTe` will be changed to `End Date`.
* The date entered for the custom properties must follow the same requirements as that of `add` command.
* You need not include the custom properties when adding a new exercise to the app.
****

Format: `custom s/PREFIX_NAME f/FULL_NAME p/PARAMETER_TYPE`

[TIP]
The following names and prefix names have been used for existing add / edit command parameters and properties and so,
cannot be used.
|===========
|Names used | Prefix names used
|Name       |  n
|Date       |  d
|Calories   |  c
|Quantity   |  q
|Unit       |  u
|Muscle     |  m
|-          |  t
|-          |  i
|===========

Example:

* `custom s/a f/Rating p/Number`

Creates a `Rating` property for each exercise.
Information for this property can be updated for each exercise by using `a/NUMBER` in the relevant command where `NUMBER` refers to
a number.

* `custom s/b f/rEmaRk p/Text`

Creates a `Remark` property for each exercise.
Information for this property can be updated for each exercise by using `b/TEXT` in the relevant command where
`TEXT` refers to a text sentence.

* `custom s/ed f/End Date p/Date`

Creates a `End Date` property for each exercise.
Information for this property can be updated for each exercise by using `ed/DATE` in the relevant command where
`DATE` refers to a date.

Using `Rating` as an example, you can now perform the following actions after adding it:

* `add t/exercise n/Run d/01/10/2019 a/5`

Adds an exercise with the name `Run`, date `01/10/2019` and rating `5` into the app.

* `edit t/exercise i/4 a/3`

Edits the rating of the 4th exercise in the list to `3`.

==== Removing custom properties: `custom`

Removes a custom property which you have previously defined either from a single exercise
or from ExerHealth.

In the second case, you will still be able to add back the deleted custom property if you
wish to.

****
* `FULL_NAME` denotes the name of the previously defined custom property.
* The index, if provided, must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
****

Format: `custom rm/FULL_NAME [i/INDEX]`

Example:

* `custom rm/Rating`

Removes the custom property `Rating` from all of the exercises and from ExerHealth.

* `custom rm/Rating i/1`

Removes the custom property `Rating` from the 1st exercise in the list.

==== Viewing custom properties: `viewcustom`

Opens up a window for you to view the custom properties you have defined.
The name, prefix and parameter type of all existing custom properties will be shown.

Format: `viewcustom`

Example:

* `viewcustom`

Opens up a window containing information of all existing custom properties.
