== Introduction

Wish to get the summer body that the contestants in your school’s
beauty pageant has? Want to shed some weight that you have gained
from stress-eating?

Well wait no more! ExerHealth is a one-stop platform for students
who wish to embark on a journey of health and fitness. This application
is optimised for students who prefer to work with a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User
Interface (GUI). If you can type fast and wish to maintain a healthy
lifestyle, ExerHealth is that one app for you!

Interested? Jump to <<Quick Start>> to get started! Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Download the latest `exerhealth.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for ExerHealth.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

[[customproperty]]
=== Custom properties: `custom`

==== Adding custom properties

Adds in a custom property which you can define for the exercises.

Once a new custom property is created, you can simply use the prefix name which you defined for the
property to the `add` and `edit` command to include information for the new property.

****
* The prefix name can only contain alphabets and should not contain spaces.
* You must choose exactly one of the following as the parameter type for your custom property:
`Text`, `Number`, `Date`.
* Every word in the full name of each custom property will be changed to Start Case style, where the first letter of each
word is capitalised with the other letters in lower case e.g. `enD DaTe` will be changed to `End Date`.
* The date entered for the custom properties must follow the same requirements as that of `add` command.
* You need not include the custom properties when adding a new exercise to the app.
****

Format: `custom s/PREFIX_NAME f/FULL_NAME p/PARAMETER_TYPE`

Example:

* `custom s/a f/Ratings p/Number`

Creates a `Ratings` property for each exercise.
Information for this property can be updated for each exercise by using `a/NUMBER` in the relevant command where `NUMBER` refers to
a number.

* `custom s/b f/rEmaRk p/Text`

Creates a `Remark` property for each exercise.
Information for this property can be updated for each exercise by using `b/TEXT` in the relevant command where
`TEXT` refers to a text sentence.

* `custom s/c f/End Date p/Date`

Creates a `End Date` property for each exercise.
Information for this property can be updated for each exercise by using `s/DATE` in the relevant command where
`DATE` refers to a date.

Using `Ratings` as an example, you can now perform the following actions after adding it:

* `add t/exercise n/Run d/01/10/2019 a/5`

Adds an exercise with the name `Run`, date `01/10/2019` and ratings `5` into the app.

* `edit t/exercise i/4 a/3`

Edits the ratings of the 4th exercise in the list to `3`.

==== Removing custom properties

Removes a custom property which you have previously defined.
This removes the custom property from all exercises.

[TIP]
`FULL_NAME` denotes the name of the previously defined custom property.

Format: `custom rm/FULL_NAME`

Example:

* `custom rm/Ratings`
* `custom rm/Remark`

=== Scheduling exercises: `schedule`

==== Schedules a regime

Schedules an exercise regime for a certain date. If regime clashes with another scheduled regime, users will be prompted to resolve the conflict via a popup window. Refer to <<resolve>> for details on resolving scheduling conflicts.

Format: `schedule n/REGIME_NAME d/DATE`

Example:

* `schedule n/cardio d/12/12/2019`

Schedules the regime called `cardio` on the date `12/12/2019`. If there are no other regimes scheduled on `12/12/2019` then the command is successful. Otherwise, you will be prompted to resolve the scheduling conflict.

==== Completes a schedule regime

Once a scheduled regime is completed, users can add that regime to the exercise tracker. The schedule is then deleted from the scheduling list.

Format: `schedule i/INDEX_OF_REGIME_IN_SCHEDULE`

Example:

* `schedule i/2`

Completes all the exercises that are in the schedule at index `2`. All the exercises will be added to the exercise list and the schedule at index `2` is deleted.
[[resolve]]
=== Resolving scheduling conflicts: `resolve`

==== Taking one of the conflicting regimes completely

Takes the scheduled regime or the conflicting regime completely and discarding the other. Neither regimes will be completely deleted from the user’s collection.

Format: `resolve n/SCHEDULED_OR_CONFLICTING`

Example:

* `resolve n/scheduled`

Takes the already scheduled regime and schedule it at conflicting date.

* `resolve n/conflicting`

Takes the conflicting regime and schedule it at conflicting date.

==== Taking some exercises from some regime
Takes some exercises from the scheduled regime and some from the conflicting regime to make a brand new regime. The new regime that is a result of the combination will be added  to the user’s collection and scheduled at the date of conflict. This new regime will also be added to the user’s collection of regimes

Format: `resolve n/REGIME_NAME [i/INDEX_OF_EXERCISE_IN_SCHEDULED]... [r/INDEX_OF_EXERCISE_IN_CONFLICTING]...`

****
* Takes the exercise at the specified `INDEX`.
* A new regime with `REGIME_NAME` will be created and added to user's collection
* `REGIME_NAME` must be a new name that does not exist in user's collection
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed conflict resolving window.
* The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* i/ is for index of the scheduled regime
* r/ is for index of the conflicting regime
****

Example:

* `resolve n/cardios i/1 i/2 i/3 r/4 r/2`

Takes exercise 1, 2, 3 from scheduled regime and exercise 2, 4 from conflicting regime and adds them to a new regime called cardios

=== Suggesting ideas: `suggest`
==== Suggest basic exercises
Recommends exercises from ExerHealth's inbuilt database for beginners.

Format: `suggest s/basic`

==== Suggest possible exercises
Suggests exercises matching specified tags.

===== Based on matching muscle tags
Format: `suggest s/possible o/OPERATION_TYPE [m/MUSCLE CUSTOM_PROPERTY_PREFIX_NAME/VALUE]`

****
* You must choose one of the following operation type: `and`, `or`.
* You have to enter at least one property (muscle/custom property) to search for suggestions.

* i.e commands such as
`suggest s/possible o/and` and `suggest s/possible o/or` will both fail
whereas `suggest s/possible o/or m/Chest` will not.
****
===== Based on matching custom properties

After creating <<customproperty, Custom Properties>> and tracking exercises,
you can search for suggestions with those custom properties.

Example:
Suppose you have created a new Custom Property and have been tracking a few exercises with said custom property:

`custom s/r f/Rating p/Number`

`add t/exercise n/Run d/01/11/2019 c/100 q/30 u/km m/Leg r/8`

`add t/exercise n/Bench Press d/01/11/2019 c/100 q/30 u/counts m/Chest r/8`


Then, the following input will display a list of exercises which are tagged with "Chest" and have a rating of 8.

`suggest s/possible o/and m/Chest r/8`

Thus the command will display only the exercise named "Bench Press".

=== Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program. +
Format: `exit`

=== Saving the data

ExerHealth data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. +
There is no need to save manually.

=== Suggest intensity `[Coming in v2.0]`

=== Remind to do exercises `[coming in v2.0]`

Reminds you to do exercises.

=== Autocomplete of commands `[coming in v2.0]`

Autocompletes the commands while typing.

=== Importing data `[coming in v2.0]`

Imports data to update inbuilt database of exercises.

// tag::dataencryption[]
=== Encrypting data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_{explain how the user can enable/disable data encryption}_
// end::dataencryption[]
