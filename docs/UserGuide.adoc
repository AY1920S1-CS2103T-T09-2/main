== Introduction

AddressBook Level 3 (AB3) is for those who *prefer to use a desktop app for managing contacts*. More importantly, AB3 is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, AB3 can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? Jump to the <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `addressbook.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`list`* : lists all contacts
* **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.
* **`delete`**`3` : deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list
* *`exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

== Features

====
*Command Format*

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
====

=== Adding exercise/regime information: `add`

==== Adding exercise information +

Adds the relevant exercise information into ExerHealth.
You can enter the following additional information for each exercise:

* Calories burnt in kcal
* Quantity of exercises completed and its units of measure
* Muscle group(s) that are being worked out

Format: `add t/exercise n/EXERCISE_NAME d/DATE [c/CALORIES] [q/QUANTITY] [u/UNITS] [m/MUSCLE]...`

****
* Dates that are entered have to be of the form `dd/MM/yyyy`.
* The day of each date must be between 1 and 31 inclusive.
* The month of each date must be between 1 and 12 inclusive.
* If the day of the month entered is within the above range but exceeds the number of days present
in that particular month, the date will be treated as the last day of that particular month e.g. if
`31/02/2019` is entered, it will be treated as `28/02/2019`.
****

Examples:

* `add t/exercise n/Run d/19/09/2019`
* `add t/exercise n/Swimming d/19/09/2019 c/2000`
* `add t/exercise n/Bench press d/19/09/2019 c/500 q/50 u/reps m/Chest`

==== Adding exercises to scheduling regime +

Adds exercises from the exercises you have added into a new exercise regime.
If a regime of the same name already exists, exercises will be added to the same scheduling regime.

Format: `add t/regime [n/REGIME_NAME] [i/INDEX]...`

Example:

* `add t/regime n/power sets i/1 i/2 i/3`

Adds the 1st, 2nd and 3rd exercise in the list to the regime named `power sets`.

* `add t/regime n/cardio i/4`

Adds the 4th exercise in the list to the regime named `cardio`.

=== Listing all exercises : `list`

Retrieves all categories of information - Exercise and Regime - from ExerHealth.

If you provide a category name, only information from that category will be shown.
You can also include start and end dates to restrict the range of dates.
If no dates are supplied, the most recent week of information from each category will be shown.

Format: `list [t/CAT_NAME] [s/START_DATE] [e/END_DATE]`

Example:

* `list`
* `list t/exercise`
* `list t/regime`
* `list t/exercise s/12/12/2019 e/17/12/2019`

=== Edit exercise information: `edit`

Edits the relevant exercise information into ExerHealth.
You can edit all the possible information for exercises except for custom properties.

****
* The date entered for this command must follow the same requirements as that of `add` command.
****

Format: `edit t/exercise i/INDEX [n/EXERCISE_NAME] [d/DATE] [c/CALORIES] [q/QUANTITY] [u/UNITS] [m/MUSCLE]...`

****
* Edits the exercise at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed exercise list. The index *must be a positive integer* 1, 2, 3, ...
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
****

Example:

* `edit t/exercise i/2 n/Running d/20/09/2019`

Edits the name and the date of the 2nd exercise to `Running` and `20/09/2019` respectively.

* `edit t/exercise i/4 n/Swim d/21/09/2019 c/100`

Edits the name, date and calories burnt of the 4th exercise to `Swim`, `21/09/2019` and `100` respectively.

* `edit t/exercise i/3 n/Bench press d/22/09/2019 c/240 q/10 u/sets m/Chest`

Edits the name, date, calories burnt, quantity, units and muscle group trained of the 3rd exercise to `Bench press`,
`22/09/2019`, `240`, `10`, `sets` and `Chest` respectively.

=== Custom properties: `custom`

==== Adding custom properties

Adds in a custom property which you can define for the exercises.

Once a new custom property is created, you can simply use the short name which you defined for the
property to the `add` and `edit` command to include information for the new property.

****
* You must choose exactly one of the following as the parameter type for your custom property:
`Text`, `Number`, `Date`.
* Every word in the full name of each custom property will be changed to Start Case style, where the first letter of each
word is capitalised with the other letters in lower case e.g. `enD DaTe` will be changed to `End Date`.
* The date entered for the custom properties must follow the same requirements as that of `add` command.
* You need not include the custom properties when adding a new exercise to the app.
****

Format: `custom s/SHORT_NAME f/FULL_NAME p/PARAMETER_TYPE`

Example:

* `custom s/a f/Ratings p/Number`

Creates a `Ratings` property for each exercise.
Information for this property can be updated for each exercise by using `a/NUMBER` in the relevant command where `NUMBER` refers to
a number.

* `custom s/b f/rEmaRk p/Text`

Creates a `Remark` property for each exercise.
Information for this property can be updated for each exercise by using `b/TEXT` in the relevant command where
`TEXT` refers to a non-empty sentence.

* `custom s/c f/End Date p/Date`

Creates a `End Date` property for each exercise.
Information for this property can be updated for each exercise by using `s/DATE` in the relevant command where
`DATE` refers to a date.

Using `Ratings` as an example, you can now perform the following actions after adding it:

* `add t/exercise n/Run d/01/10/2019 a/5`

Adds an exercise with the name `Run`, date `01/10/2019` and ratings `5` into the app.

* `edit t/exercise i/4 a/3`

Edits the ratings of the 4th exercise in the list to `3`.

==== Removing custom properties

Removes a custom property which you have previously defined.
This removes the custom property from all exercises.

[TIP]
`FULL_NAME` denotes the name of the previously defined custom property.

Format: `custom r/FULL_NAME`

Example:

* `custom r/Ratings`
* `custom r/Remark`
